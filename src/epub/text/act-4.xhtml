									<span>That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:⁠—</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Environed with all these hideous fears?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And madly play with my forefather’s joints?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, look! methinks I see my cousin’s ghost</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon a rapier’s point: stay, Tybalt, stay!</span>
