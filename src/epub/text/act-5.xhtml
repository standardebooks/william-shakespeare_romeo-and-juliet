									<br/>
									<span>Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>An alligator stuff’d, and other skins</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Noting this penury, to myself I said</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“An if a man did need a poison now,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, this same thought did but forerun my need;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And this same needy man must sell it me.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As I remember, this should be the house.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Death, that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,</span>
									<br/>

									<span>Thou art not conquer’d; beauty’s ensign yet</span>

									<span>That unsubstantial death is amorous,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And never from this palace of dim night</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Depart again: here, here will I remain</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will I set up my everlasting rest,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!</span>

									<span>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</span>

									<span>I married them; and their stol’n marriage-day</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Then gave I her, so tutor’d by my art,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As I intended, for it wrought on her</span>

									<span>Being the time the potion’s force should cease.</span>
